    "Python is a general-purpose programming language that allows us to create programs, analyse data, create websites, create applications, and many other cool things. It is free and open-source, which means that anyone can contribute to its development and help make this language an even better one. This latter fact, along with the great readability of the language, are (to your host) two of the major contributing factors of Python's popularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python can be thought of as a person, we are very cool the way we are but to interact more efficiently we make use of \"add-ons\", and thus, so does Python. These add-ons may be clothes, shoes, accessories, slang words, and other physical objects such as cars, houses, boats, etc. In Python, our add-ons become additional programs other people have created in order to make a specific workflow easier.\n",

    "- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) -> \"is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- [numpy](https://numpy.org/) -> \"is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things, a powerful N-dimensional array object, sophisticated (broadcasting) functions, tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code, useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) -> \"is a Python-based ecosystem of open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For Data Visualisation\n",
    "\n",
    "- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) -> \"is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) -> \"s a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- [altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/index.html) -> Although Altair has not had the same adoption from the community as the previous two data visualisation libraries, it is a great library for visualising your data.\n",

Amazon always seems to know what to recommend you to buy (and crap, it seems to work). Now you start getting curious about all of the data your smartwatch might have about you so you decide that it is time to take control of your own data before others analyse it for you.\n",

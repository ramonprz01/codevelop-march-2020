This being a completely novel endeavor for you, something no one else picks during New Year's (😎), you decide it would good to also track your progress throughout your journey, so you get a smart watch to aid you in this regard.\n",

Facebook know which kinds of posts you like the most, and has a good sense regarding your political inclinations based on the things you post. Amazon always seems to know what to recommend you to buy (and crap, it seems to work). Now you start getting curious about all of the data your smartwatch might have about you so you decide that it is time to take control of your own data before others analyse it for you.\n",
